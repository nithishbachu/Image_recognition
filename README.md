CIFAR-10 Image Classification Using TensorFlow

In this project, I explored image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset with TensorFlow and Keras. I built two neural network models: a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and a more complex Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The dataset features 60,000 color images in 10 different classes.

I loaded and normalized the data, trained both models, and evaluated their performance using classification reports and confusion matrices. Additionally, I included visualizations of sample images alongside their predicted labels.

This project reflects my foundational skills in deep learning, data preprocessing, and model evaluation, making it a strong addition to my portfolio as I pursue job opportunities in data science and machine learning. Future enhancements could involve experimenting with different model architectures and applying data augmentation techniques.
