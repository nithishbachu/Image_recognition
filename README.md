# Image_recognition
This project uses TensorFlow and Keras to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, featuring 60,000 color images across 10 classes. I implemented both an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), evaluating their performance with visualizations and classification reports.
